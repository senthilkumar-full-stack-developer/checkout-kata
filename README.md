# Checkout Kata

Implemented a solution for a checkout kata that follows the requirements below: 

1.	Given I have selected to add an item to the basket Then the item should be added to the basket
2.	Given items have been added to the basket Then the total cost of the basket should be calculated
3.	Given I have added a multiple of 3 lots of item ‘B’ to the basket Then a promotion of ‘3 for 40’ should be applied to every multiple of 3 (see: Grid 1).
4.	Given I have added a multiple of 2 lots of item ‘D’ to the basket Then a promotion of ‘25% off’ should be applied to every multiple of 2 (see: Grid 1).

### Grid 1:
| Item SKU  | Unit Price | Promotions                             |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| A         | 10         |                                        |
| B         | 15         | 3 for 40                               |
| C         | 40         |                                        |
| D         | 55         | 25% off for every 2 purchased together |

Items are priced individually. In addition, there are promotions which can affect the total price of the basket, for example, when 3 lots of item ‘D’ are added to the basket then a 25% deduction is applied to the total cost of 2 of those items. The pricing changes frequently, so pricing should be independent of the checkout.
